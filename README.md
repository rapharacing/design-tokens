# Rapha Design Tokens

Design tokens are atomic pieces that store visual design attributes. They help us make our UI more consistent and consistent and support custom themes. We use them instead of static values like HEX codes for color or sizing units.

## Formats

The main structure of the package is written in `JavaScript` for better usage in `JavaScript` projects. We are also able to generate a `JSON` file which will allow us to transform this type of file into different ones. It should be possible to transform `JSON` into `SASS`, `LESS`, `Stylus`, `XML` or others.
